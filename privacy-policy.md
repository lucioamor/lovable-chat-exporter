**Privacy Policy — Lovable Chat Exporter**

This extension does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

All chat messages captured by the extension are stored exclusively in your local browser using `chrome.storage.local`. This data never leaves your device and is never sent to any external server, including ours.

The extension reads page content solely on `lovable.dev` and only to enable you to export your own conversation history. No browsing history, credentials, or personal information are accessed or stored.

You can clear all stored data at any time using the "Clear captured data" button in the extension popup.
